Intro:
This is my project for the TripleTen course.
 For making this project I used such instruments and resources:
 To store and work on it - GitHub
 Main build, EDA - VS.Code
 Testing - VS.Code, Spyder
 Deployment - Render 
 Help - ChatGPT
 Some launchiing and file management was done in Terminal CLI
 

What is this app and how I made it:
This app represents the filtered subset of initial dataset vehicles_us.csv
The data was preproccesed before conducting analysis on it by checking values types and changing them if neccessary to avoid conflicts, checking duplicates and missing data with further replacement of those. After the initial dataset was clean, I conducted the data analysis. 
During the analysis I tried to focus on what might be intresting and valuable for the viewer and tried to narrow down my research to represent these points. From what I discovered, some price range is significanlty more popular, comparing to other price segments, so I decided to focus on it and build my research and application around it. 

How to use:
On the left side you can find the filter section. Feel free to play around with it and adjust the represented data to your interest.
