Introduction
This project is part of the TripleTen course. It showcases my skills in data analysis, visualization, and web application development. For this project, I utilized:

GitHub for version control and collaboration
VS Code and Spyder for development and testing
Render for deployment
ChatGPT for assistance during development
I also used CLI for file management and task automation.
